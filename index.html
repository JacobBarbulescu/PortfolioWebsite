      </div>
      <div class="dropdown-body">
		<br>
		<p>Over the last few years,&nbsp;AI has seen some incredible developments.</p>
		<p>I quickly realized that I had a unique oppurtunity to work with and learn AI systems as they were being developed.</p>
		<p>I developed a passion for Artificial Intelligence,&nbsp;especially with its potential in providing public goods</p>

      <img id="HeraHealth-Logo" alt="HeraHealth Logo" src="images/HeraHealth/HeraHealth-Logo.jpg" class="left-image expandable">

      <p>I am currently working with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/herahealthinc/about/" target="_blank">HeraHealth</a>, a women's health technology startup to develop an AI-powered Postpartum Hemorrhage Tracking App.</p>
      <p>My main role on the team is to train, optimize, and implement a computer vision model capable of tracking blood loss in new mothers via pictures of their pads. However, as with many startups, I am wearing many hats.</p>
      <p>This has given me the unique and exciting opportunity to see all sides of a application's development, including frontend and backend development, community outreach and user testing, and the legal hurdles of developing a health application.</p>

      <br>

      <p>For new mothers, the leading cause of death is postpartum hemorrhaging, which is a risk that can last up to 12 weeks after birth. With the HeraHealth app, these mothers would be able to automatically track and detect this hemorrhaging before it becomes life threatening.</p>
      <p>Being able to use AI to tackle a dangerous problem that affects some of our most vulnerable people was a very inspiring oppurtunity for me. </p>

      <br>

      <p>Training the computer vision model was a powerful learning experience for me. I was lucky to have a team with absolute pros who were kind enough to guide me through the process, explain the logic behind the training, and point me to great resources for self study</p>
      <p>Due to the medical nature of the project, finding data for our training was difficult. We had a single dataset that showed pads labelled with the amount of blood on them, but it could only do so much to improve model accuracy. We ended up using data augmentation methods to extend the dataset and make the model more robust with different image qualities, angles, and lighting.</p>
      <p>Our model was tested, showed extremely high accuracy, even with image conditions it had not been previusly exposed to, and is now ready to be implemented into the application.</p>

      <br>

      <img alt="Test results of the computer vision model" src="images/HeraHealth/Test-Results.png" class="expandable">

      <br>

      <p>With the AI model done, I have shifted my attention to 3 other aspects of the project: the app, the users, and the law.</p>
      <p>We are currently creating a React-powered app to allow for easy cross-platform publishing. While our main goal is to develop mobile applications, we are also keeping the app easily modifiable and scalable to allow for future work such as a website.</p>
      <p>I am also spending time reaching out to mothers and healthcare professionals to interview them. Through these interviews, I can help inform design decisions, better understand my target demographic, and foster a connection with our potential userbase.</p>
      <p>Working on an app designed for medical use has also required me and my team to be very conscientious about HIPPA compliance and general user privacy. Adhering closely to cybersecurity principles and methodologies had been a direct way of addressing these concerns. However, we have also reached out to health law experts throughout our development cycle to ensure compliance and make our application properly secure.</p>

      <br>

      <p>Our timeline is to finish the app by the end of December, then perform user testing and quality assurance in the Spring as we prepare for a full release at the summer's start.</p>
      <p>This entire development process has been an amazing learning experience for me, and I am grateful to be able to work on such an impactful issue with such a talented team.</p>
      <p>My experience with working on a production-level project is teaching me a web of skills that I will carry with me into my future projects</p>

      <p>Under the mentorship of Dr. Sang Won Bae and Dr. Rahul Islam,&nbsp;I helped design <strong>PECO</strong>,&nbsp;an AI-powered mental health support coaching system.</p>
      <p>This coaching system helped to address the shortage of professional mental health support in the United States.</p>
      <p>I presented this work at the <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/semcer-center-for-healthcare-innovation/next-gen-healthcare-innovators-symposium-2025" target="_blank">Stevens Next-Gen Healthcare Innovators Symposium 2025</a>.</p>
      <br>

      <img alt="An example of PECO's chat interface" src="images/PECO/Chat-Example.png" class="left-image expandable" width="420" height="240">
      <br>
      <p>PECO (AI-Powered <strong>PE</strong>er <strong>CO</strong>aching System) is a novel training platform designed to strengthen the skills of peer supporters. PECO enables users to engage in simulated conversations with an AI-generated support seeker and receive live feedback from FIDO (<strong>F</strong>eedback for <strong>I</strong>mproving <strong>D</strong>ial<strong>O</strong>gue). FIDO provides indirect, descriptive feedback that highlights opportunities for improvement while encouraging users to revise their own responses. This reflective feedback style is intended to preserve the user's voice and foster active learning.</p>
      <br>
      <p>PECO integrates two AI models: the simulated seeker and the feedback engine, FIDO. The simulated seeker is built upon <a href="" target="_blank">Patient-Ψ</a>, a large language model (LLM) framework that employs Cognitive Conceptualization Profiles to generate realistic mental health patients in varied scenarios. FIDO is a custom model fine-tuned on Meta's <a href="" target="blank">LLaMA 4 Scout model</a>.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Fine tuning was performed using annotated datasets from studies on mental health conversations, including labels for support strategies and seeker emotions and tendencies. FIDO provides feedback by generating a response to messages from the simulated seeker, comparing to the user's proposed message, and instructing on where improvements can be made. Additionally, PECO allows users to select specific traits in seekers they want to practice with, such as “hostile” or “verbose”.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This work was presented at the <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/semcer-center-for-healthcare-innovation/next-gen-healthcare-innovators-symposium-2025" target="_blank">Stevens Next-Gen Healthcare Innovators Symposium 2025</a>, a research symposium dedicated to technology-driven healthcare solutions.</p>

      </div>

      <br>

      <p>I personally learned a lot from this research. It was my first experience working with AI to solve a real problem, and that was both exciting and challenging.</p>
      <p>The biggest lesson I learned is that asking for help is the best way to learn. The biggest leaps of progress I made were always after I asked others for advice, either from my advisors or from experts I approached myself. They always had great insight and introduced me to many powerful tricks and tools that helped me on my journey.</p>
      <p>This research also helped kickstart my fascination with AI and the public good it can bring. Applications of Artificial Intelligence in fields such as healthcare can provide massive amounts of good to society, and it has been very inspiring to work on projects that can contribute to this common good.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Coding has been a passion in my life since my Freshman year of high school.</p>
        <p>Covid was still keeping us all trapped indoors, so I decided on a whim to learn Python, and I just kept going from there.</p>
        <p>Through both school and personla projects, I have been developing my knowledge on programming constantly</p>

          <p>In a project for my <strong>Computer Architecture and Organization</strong> course at Stevens Institute of Technology, I was assigned with creating a <strong>custom CPU</strong> from scratch.</p>
          <p>Using <strong>Logism Pro</strong>, I was able to make a CPU with 4 registers, an accessible RAM for data, and a display to show values.</p>
          <p>I also created an Assembly language that could be compiled into binary code and be executed by the CPU.</p>
          <br>

          <img alt="The Barbusoft circuit" id="barbusoft-main-picture" src="images/Barbusoft/Main-CPU.png" class="left-image expandable" width="420" height="240">
          <br>
          <p>It was a fun challenge creating as much functionality as possible with basic instructions.&nbsp;I assigned only 16 bits to each instruction, yet still had an addition, subtraction, loading, storing, displaying, and setting function for a user to implement in their programs.&nbsp;The CPU allowed for both the use of 2 registers or a register and a 4-bit immediate number for its instructions, and the user could even display register values or immediate numbers.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The CPU also had a RAM that was accessible by the program.&nbsp;Register values could be stored at specified addresses in the RAM, and data could also be retrieved from the RAM and stored in registers.&nbsp;The instructions for a program were stored in a separate RAM, and a program counter would automatically iterate through the stored instructions until it reach an empty instruction.&nbsp;At that point, the CPU would automatically stay at that empty instruction to end the program.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The user would be able to write an assembly program, then compile it using a compiler that I wrote in Python.&nbsp;The compiler converted a custom .barb assembly file into a hexadecimal image readable by the CPU, and the compiler allowed for comments, whitespace, and empty lines.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I also made a manual for the CPU to help others understand and write programs for it.&nbsp;It gets into the grittier details of how the CPU works and how one can write, compile, and run code for it.&nbsp;Feel free to give it a read by <a href="./pdf/Barbusoft-Manual.pdf" target="_blank" download>downloading the manual</a>.</p>

          </div>

          <p>I was able to make the CPU, assembly language, and compiler in a day, and I am very proud of the result.</p>
          <p>I've spent a fair bit of time just writing custom programs for the CPU and watching it do its thing.&nbsp;Assembly becomes a lot more fun when you're the one who designed it!</p>

          <p>I was an involved environmental activist at my high school, and so I was invited to join the <a href="https://www.climaterealityproject.org/" target="_blank">Climate Reality</a> NJ Youth Chapter.</p>
          <p>After talking about my coding hobby, they quickly arranged for me to build a website for their chapter.</p>
          <br>

          <img alt ="The Climate Reality home page" id="climate-main-picture" src="images/Climate-Website/Main.png" class="right-image expandable" width="420" height="240">
          <p>Effectively, the website was meant to be a database full of articles for teachers and students.&nbsp;Teachers would be given learning plans and student would be given educational reading on environmental issues.&nbsp;The most difficult part was this: every member had to be able to go onto the website, write an article, and post it onto the website to be accessed.&nbsp;I had to find a secure yet user-friendly way for my teammates to write these articles with, and this took me some time to figure out.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I eventually settled on <a href="https://www.tiny.cloud" target="_blank">TinyMCE</a>, a rich text editor than can easily be implemented into a website.&nbsp;A teammate could go onto an article creation page, use TinyMCE to write the article (including content such as images and videos), add a title, tags, etc., then send it to the server as an html file.&nbsp;The server would then take this html file and store it in the porper folder (There was a folder tree of teachers and students, and each tree was separated into grade levels).&nbsp;Now, a user could go onto the site and search for an article using keywords and filters for user-type and grade level.&nbsp;The website would automatically find every relevant article and list them out for the user to enter. When clicked, the user would be brought to the corresponding article.</p>

          <br>
          <p>The website was eventually fully finished and hosted, and my team immediately began using to create and post their resources.&nbsp;Altough the website is no longer online, I am still proud of the contribution that I made to the Climate Reality project.</p>

          <p>The first website I ever made was for a friend. He offered to pay me some cash to make him a calendar website, so I immediately got to work learning how to even make a website.</p>

          <img alt="The home page of the commisioned website" id="henry-main-picture" src="images/Henry-Website/Main.png" class="left-image expandable" width="420" height="240">
          <p>He effectively wanted to be able to add events to an online calendar (like Google Calendar), except everybody who went on the website accessed and modified the same calendar.&nbsp;Although the website was simple, sending user input to the server, storing it, then later retrieving it was a big challenge for me to learn.&nbsp;I eventually came up with a solution using <strong>Node.js</strong> involving using a manifest text file to store the events, then the server would read this text file and send the events to the user.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The user was able to add an event, specifying its name, date, time, location, and description, and this would be sent and stored in the server.&nbsp;The user could then view a month or a day.&nbsp;The month would show a list of days with events in them, and this would have a brief look at the events.&nbsp;The user could also look at a specific day, and here they would find more details on each event.&nbsp;Lastly, the user could delete any event, making the calendar fully modifiable.</p>

        <p>Video games are my passion, and building games of my own has been a wonderful journey.</p>
        <p>Starting in high school, I taught myself how to use game engines such as <strong>Unity</strong> and <strong>Game Maker Studio</strong>, and I even made my own engine via <strong>OpenGL</strong>!</p>
        <p>I am a member of the <strong>Stevens Game Development Club</strong>, where I have participated in their game jams and learned a lot about how professionals make their games.</p>
        <p>I work at it as much as I can outside of school, and I have made a few projects so far that I am proud of.</p>

          <br>
          <p><a href="https://outrider.org/projects/oregon-road-83" target="_blank">Oregon 83</a> is a project currently being developed by Professor Alex Wellerstein at Stevens Institute of Technology.&nbsp;The game is designed for the player to experience an alternate history America where the nuclear tensions in 1983 boiled over and the world entered a nuclear exchange.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The game combines heavy research of the time period with an homage to The Oregon Trail to make a historically accurate survival game where the player must cross the country to reach their brother's bunker in Oregon.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This project is the first large-scale video game that I have ever worked on, and it has taught me many unique lessons.</p>
          <br>

          <br>

          <p>My work on the project was with the audio team.&nbsp;I not only contributed to the team by making music and sound effects myself, but also by helping to implement the audio in the game engine.</p>
          <p>The game uses a custom-built Javascript engine, meaning that it was up to the audio team to organize the audio system in the code.&nbsp;We eventually settled on <a href="https://www.fmod.com/" target="_blank">FMOD</a>, a third party software meant to allow game developers to implement dynamic audio.</p>
          <p>By setting up audio events and parameters to control those events, we could abstract the code behind playing the proper audio at the right time to a simple changing-of-variables for the programmers.&nbsp;This also allowed us to experiment with dynamic audio systems. For example, we drafted a general travel theme that would change based on which companions you had in your party.</p>

          <p>The most important lesson that I learned from this project was the value of organization.</p>
          <p>The audio team alone had 11 people in it, and so I thought production would be easy. However, the opposite was true.</p>
          <p>That many people working on the same project lead to clashing ideas, redundant work, and a general lack of direction.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>One of the most important contributions that I made to the project wasn't any of the music that I made or the FMOD system that I implemented, but this:</p>
          <p>I helped to create a list of all of the music and sound effects that we absolutely needed for the project, ranging from car engine noises to the menu theme. I then made an FMOD event for each piece of audio that we needed and shared it with the team.</p>
          <p>Now, instead of simply working on whatever they thought was worth doing, the team had a clear, managable list of individual tasks to work through.</p>
          <p>This significantly improved the workflow of the team, as now team members were able to work on the project and feel confident that what they were doing was effective.</p>

          <br>

          <p>Although the project is still under development, I am extremely grateful to work on a video game of a larger scale. It taught me many valuable lessons about video game development that will stick with me for the rest of my career.</p>
          <p>I learned the importance of organization, how to work within a larger team, and how to communicate with others to make sure that everyone worked towards one unified vision.</p>

          <p><strong>Deck Thrower</strong> was made for the first Stevens Game Development Club's Game Jam that I participated in.</p>
          <p>I had 48 hours to build the game based on the theme they gave (Unusual Weapon).</p>
          <p>I was able to finish the game by the deadline and got 2nd place in the entire jam!</p>
          <p>I made all of the game's assets myself during the jam.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Some time after the jam, I decided to polish up the game into a more completed state.</p>
          <p>I added art, sound, and music, added a main menu, and also squashed many bugs.</p>
          <p>I'm proud of the game that it has become.</p>

          <p><strong>Fruity Catcher</strong> was the first game that I ever fully completed.</p>
          <p>Although it is simple, it took over a month to develop simply because I was teaching Unity to myself as I made it.</p>
          <p>This game is a fruit catcher game, where the player must move around the ground to catch fruit falling from a tree.</p>
          <p>However, I also added bombs and powerups to make things more exciting!</p>
          <p>The powerups range from making the player bigger to slowing down gravity to having everything spawn in faster!</p>
          <p>Every asset in the game, from the sprites to the music, is entirely made by me.</p>
          <br>
          <p>One of the largest challenges of the game was organization.</p>
          <p>Even something as simple as keeping score required a lot of work to keep everything organized.</p>
          <p>I eventually learned to use game managers to keep every aspect of the game modular and abstracted.</p>
          <p>Rather than have my collision code also apply the powerup when the player picks up one, it simply asks the powerup manager to do so.</p>
          <p>Rather than have my menu screen handle the transition to the main game, I simply had my menu manager do the work itself.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I eventually submitted this game to the <strong>Computer and Console Gaming Society</strong> and the <strong>Stevens Game Development Club's</strong> gaming tournament.</p>
          <p>This event had many students on my campus come together and compete to earn in the best scores in games developed by the Stevens Game Development Club.</p>
          <p>It was fun and very rewarding to see a whole group of people play my game and get very competitive over it!</p>

        <p>Music has always been a large part of my life from childhood.</p>
        <p>I started off by playing the piano and eventually trombone, but in high school I evolved from playing music to making music.</p>
        <p>Using <a href="https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio/" target="_blank">FL Studio</a>, I have been creating song after song over the years, slowly honing my skills.</p>
        <p>I challenge myself to work in a variety of genres, and I always make my own music for the video games that I develop.</p>

            <h2>Weeoo</h2>
            <p>This song was a challenge I gave myself to make a song entirely out of samples.</p>
            <p>I used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ag94UU01TQ" target="_blank" class="hoverable">Natalie Cordet's Cover of&nbsp;Take Five</a> as my base.</p>
            <p>I also used various sound effects and voxes that I've collected over the years.</p>
            <p>The most fun part was taking the original cover which is in 5/4 time and making it into a 4/4 song. It really makes the song feel enitrely different from it's origin!</p>

            <h2>Shades On</h2>
            <p>This song was a challenge for me to only use MIDI instruments for my song.</p>
            <p>I wanted a beach aesthetic for my song, and I was inspired by early 2000s racing games.</p>
            <p>The hardest part was making the MIDI instruments sound fuller. Although it matched the retro game aesthetic, I used a fair bit of post processing to make the instruments really pop.</p>

            <p>The game has an 8-bit style, which made for an interesting challenge in conveying emotion with simple sounds.</p>
            <p>The most fun part was making the instruments myself. I started with basic sound waves such as sine waves and square waves and combined them with post processing to create unique instruments.</p>
            <p>My vision was a somber yet hopeful feeling, and I feel that I accomplished it with this song.</p>

            <p>I was still experimenting with the theme of the game, and this song was branching towards a more high energy game than Rooftops was made for.</p>
            <p>My favorite part about the song is the strings. Although it seems like a small addition, they transformed the song into the exact early 2000s style that I wanted.</p>

            <p>This song came from me being bored one Sunday afternoon and deciding to make something fun for myself.</p>
            <p>The most challenging yet interesting part of the song was having the two different "phases" of the song mesh. I wanted to give the listener a sense of breaking through the clouds during the transitions, going from dark and heavy to light and airy.</p>
            <p>This song was also the first one where I used automation clips to enhance my sound, and it really helped me to make more dynamic music.</p>

            <p>I didn't even know what mixing meant or how to add effects to the instruments, so I spent a long time finding instruments that sounded good from the getgo.</p>
